# Mental-Health-Predictor

This (open) project was a part of the Data Focused Python graduate level course (95-888) at Carnegie Mellon University.
Our goal was to connect people in need of help to the people who can help. It was divided into the following:
1. Collect survey data to train the model on.
2. Create a regression model to predict the probability of health issues.
3. Identify severity of the condition.
4. Provide local support resources - Recreational Activities/Support Groups /Psychologists and Therapists. 


Disclaimer:
This is a sensitive issue and I acknowledge that a real-life solution is never this simple. However, this was the first step towards the right direction.
